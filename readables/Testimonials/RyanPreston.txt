“I can't say enough about what Rob has done for me as a player and a person.  I was fortunate to meet and begin working with Rob when I was coming out of my last year of 14's and trying to transition into playing at a more physical and demanding 16's and 18's level.  At the time I was still small and undersized for my age, but we knew I was going to grow and Rob was able to envision where my game was going to need to be in order to have success at an 18's level and beyond.  When I started with Rob, I had somewhat stalled in terms of the development of my tennis game, but within the first couple years under Rob I went from being a mediocre Midwest level player to being able to compete and win many more matches at the national level. I bought into Rob's vision for the best type of tennis that would suite my strengths and style. We started making adjustments and working on weaknesses, all of which allowed my game to really flourish and come together as I was starting to be recruited by several of the nations top collegiate programs.  I ended up choosing to accept a scholarship to play for Vanderbilt University and had an excellent and successful experience playing for the Commodores. There is no way that I would have ever had the career and experience that I did if I hadn't had Rob's help and guidance through that process and the years leading up to it.  Many of the lessons of professionalism, hard work, and discipline that he demanded from me on a daily basis have served me well, not only in my tennis career, but in my endevours after tennis and into medical school.  I will always consider Rob to be a great friend and mentor.”#
