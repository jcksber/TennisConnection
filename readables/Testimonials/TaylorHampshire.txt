"I started working with Rob my Sophomore year of high school when I decided to take my game to the next level.  Rob helped me achieve my goal to play Division 1 tennis where I played No. 1 singles and No. 1 doubles as a Freshman while also making an All Conference team at Lehigh University.  He pushed and challenged me both physically and mentally during every lesson which prepared me for all of my college experiences.  Not only did Rob help me on and off the court, he also helped me mature into a player that could deal with injuries, school as well as how to balance it all."#
