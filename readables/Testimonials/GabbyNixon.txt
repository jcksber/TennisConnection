“To simply thank Rob for all he has done for me is insufficient. At the beginning of my junior year I was basically forced to begin hitting  at College Park by my dad following a pretty low point in my tennis career. After just one day hitting under the guidance of Rob, it was clear to me that he was unlike any of the other coaches I had been exposed to over the years. After playing with the same coach my whole life, I had never wanted to begin working with anyone else until I saw how Rob handled his students on and off the court. His optimistic attitude and focused sessions each day have changed my entire perspective about tennis.<br><br>"When I first came to Rob I was a scrappy player who basically tried to end the point as quickly as possible. Rob taught me patience and made coming to College Park to work with him and everyone there the best part of my day. Through his challenging yet gratifying approach to tennis I have become the player I always hoped to be and enjoyed every minute. Rob's positivity, charisma, and dedication all make him the perfect person for anyone to trust to take them to new heights in tennis and teach them plenty about life along the way. Once coming off the court after a tough practice consisted of anger or tears but with Rob's reassurance I have learned to cope with mistakes and strive to improve with my head held high. Besides building me into an improved athlete and person, Rob helped me acheive my dream of playing tennis for the University of Wisconsin. I am beyond grateful to have had the opportunity to work with someone like Rob who truly made me belive in myself over these past few years. College park will always feel like a second home to me and Rob is someone I will always look up to.”#
