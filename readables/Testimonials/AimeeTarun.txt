“I started hitting with Rob Budacsek about 2.5 years ago and I can 100% say that it's the best decision I have ever made for my tennis game. I started working with him my sophomore year of high school and had high college goals, and he has  helped me achieve them. He helped me a ton and I would not be playing college tennis where I am, if it wasn't for him. He has many connections with D1-D3 college coaches and knows a great deal about the recruiting process. He has been in the tennis industry for over 30 years and has helped many kids get into colleges. He will tell you what you need to do and help you along the way. Choosing Rob's Tennis Connection services is something you will definitely not regret.“#
