“As a former student and long time friend of Rob, I can confidently say that he is the best in business when it comes to the placement of prospective collegiate tennis players.  He has a straight forward, no nonsense approach to the college recruiting process.  Rob encourages his students to strive for positions at "stretch" schools, both athletically and academically, while at the same time being honest about where they currently stand in the eyes of college recruiters and how they can best improve their chances of admission.  Perhaps his best quality, however, is his vast network of college coaches.  From the top schools of division 1 through the lower levels of division 3, he has established relationships with numerous head and assistant coaches.  If you are a prospective athlete looking for guidance in the college placement process, look no further than Rob Budacsek at Tennis Connection.”#
