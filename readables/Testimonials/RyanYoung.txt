“I started working with Rob the summer before I started college, and I honestly regret not starting with him sooner. Going into that summer I felt pretty good about my game. However, by the time I left for school, I felt very confident about starting my freshman year on the Cornell tennis team. Over the past four years, Rob has really brought my game to a whole new level by pushing me to work harder than I ever thought I could and by instilling confidence in me. Now, when I step on the court, I believe in myself so much more that I ever did before working with Rob. Thank you Rob for helping me achieve my goal of being an All-Ivy League player. I couldn’t have done it without you.”#
