"I was looking for a new tennis coach when I was 15 and just moved into the Chicago area. Rob was recommended to me and having hit with him just once, I was immediately drawn to his positive coaching style. I hadn't played many tennis tournaments at the time, but Rob had faith and belief in me and my abilities. He is a very positive person and is dedicated to his students and their growth. There is more than one way to play the game of tennis. Rob recognizes his studentâ€™s strengths and what style works best for them. He improved my game by focusing on my athleticism and helped me use it to my advantage. My game has changed drastically from the years of hitting with Rob. Today I am a scholarship D1 athlete and he is a major reason as to why I reached this high point in my life. If it weren't for his encouragement and confidence I wouldn't be where I am today."#
