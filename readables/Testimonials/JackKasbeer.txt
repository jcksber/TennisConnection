“This past summer, at the Chicago District Qualifier, I was playing Conrad Harron, someone who was known to be twice as good as me, and I had just won the second set when Rob sat me down to talk before the final third set (best of 3 sets to win).  I vividly remember Rob staring into my eyes, and with absolute confidence, he said, “Jack, you are better than this kid. You have created fear in his heart... You can win this match.  All you have to do is believe in your talent.” That’s when I understood how much Rob meant to me and how much he had already impacted my life.  In that moment, I felt unstoppable.<br><br>"Rob helped me discover who I am by using my potential to create a tennis player, which simultaneously made me a better person outside of the tennis world.  He taught me discipline on the court, which in effect did the same for me off the court.  He showed me what it means to work hard at everything you do because your actions define you.  Rob worked me as hard as my body would allow every time I walked onto the tennis court, pushing my game to new levels; but the most important thing he’s ever done for me was not accomplished on the court, it was achieved off it.  Rob has incredible influence on me because of the way he shaped me throughout my high school years and showed me guidance when no one else could.  He is both my mentor and my trainer, and I will forever be indebted to him. -If you ever need help in tennis or college tennis, Rob will get you there!”
