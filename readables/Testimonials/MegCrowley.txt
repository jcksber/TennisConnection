"Rob has been a teacher, coach and mentor to me for almost six years.  I differentiate between those three terms because I believe they are very different, and to find a coach that can offer all three of those qualities is incredibly rare and special.  He is a wonderful teacher because his extensive professional experience and expertise gives him a realm of knowledge that is unmatched by most coaches.  Rob has real, applicable experience like playing on tour and he knows the game inside and out and how to pass that on to young players. Additionally, he is a coach, because he knows how to push his players to excel and compete to their full potential.  He takes the time to get to know his students and he applies that to how to coach them in the best way possible.  Rob is also an incredible mentor.  Someone who is always there to give advice or help pick you up out of a rut.  From personal experience: I have called him in college when I have felt hopeless and down about my game and he has been able to talk me through it and get me back on my feet and competing with the passion and love he knows I have for the game.  Rob has a unparalleled natural talent and enthusiasm for the game, and his ability to pass this on to junior players is evident to all who watch him coach or give a lesson.  I feel lucky to have had so many great years with him as my coach. Thanks for everything Rob!"#
